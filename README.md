# moo.lua

The little lua class builder library

## INTRODUCTION
Moo.lua is just a small library that performs all the dirty work of building classes (ie: metatables) for you. It can also handle some lightweight instancing and inheritance.

## USAGE

To create a class just use `class:new()`

```lua
-- koopa.lua
require "moo"

Koopa = class:new()
```

You now have a metatable called `Koopa`. Though it's not very useful. So, let's add some properties to it.

```lua
require "moo"

Koopa = class:new()

Koopa.Name = "Koopa"
Koopa.CanBounce = false
Koopa.ReverseAtEnd = false

function Koopa:GetMyName()
  return self.Name or "I have no name"
end
  
```

Now our Koopa class can assign a name, return if it can bounce or not, and tell us if it reverse when it reaches a cliff.

## INHERITANCE

You can use inheritance to create new Koopa classes that inherit the base (parent) Koopa class. This will give your new Koopas the default properties of Koopa 
while allowing you to override them, giving each Koopa a unique set of properties.

```lua
-- green_koopa.lua

require "moo"
require "koopa"

GreenKoopa = class:extends(Koopa)

-- We're happy with the other defaults, but want to change the name
GreenKoopa.Name = "Green Koopa"
```

You can easily loop through the children of a base class.

```lua
-- test.lua
require "koopa"
require "green_koopa" -- don't forget to load the other koopas

print("Found " .. #Koopa.children .. " koopas!")

for _, v in pairs(Koopa.children) do
  print("Name: " .. v:GetMyName()) -- GetMyName() was defined in the base class (Koopa)
  print("Can bounce: " .. tostring(v.CanBounce))
end
```

If you don't need or want direct access to the parent, you don't even have to include the koopa base

```lua
-- test.lua
require "green_koopa"

print("Green Koopa's name is " .. GreenKoopa.Name)
```

## INSTANCING
You can return an **instance** of an object by calling it as a function. Anything you perform on the instance 
will not affect the main table it was instanced from

```lua
require "green_koopa"

local greenKoopa = GreenKoopa()
greenKoopa.Name = "Instanced Green Koopa"

print(greenKoopa.Name) -- outputs: Instanced Green Koopa
print(GreenKoopa.Name) -- outputs: Green Koopa
```

Whenever you initialise an instance you can automatically get it to run a special method called `Initialize`.

```
-- green_koopa.lua

GreenKoopa = class:extends(Koopa)

function GreenKoopa:Initialize()
  print("I have been summoned!")
end

-- test.lua

local koopa = GreenKoopa() -- outputs: I have been summoned!
```

The `Initialize` method does support arguments, so you can pass stuff across if you want. Being a method, `self` is also available.
