# moo.lua
### The little lua class builder library

## INTRODUCTION
Moonscript seemed like a cool idea, but I hated the syntax. I'm doing Lua because I enjoy Lua - I'm not interested in learning another language. So I attempted to 
take the garbage Lua that Moonscript generates and move it into a library. That way, you can still write Lua and not have to worry about doing the 
metatable dance yourself.
You'll find examples in the main directory (ie: All the Koopa stuff). I'll give a short synopsis to try and explain how it works.

## SYNOPSIS

To create a class (or package as moo refers to them as) just use the `package` function

```lua
-- koopa.lua
require "moo"

package("Koopa")
```

You now have a metatable called `Koopa`. Though it's not very useful. So, let's add some properties to it.

```lua
require "moo"

package("Koopa",
  { Name = "Koopa", CanBounce = false, ReverseAtEnd = false })
  
function Koopa:GetMyName()
  return self.Name or "I have no name"
end
  
```

Now our Koopa class can assign a name, return if it can bounce or not, and tell us if it reverse when it reaches a cliff. 
You can use inheritance to create new Koopa classes that inherit the base (parent) Koopa class. This will give your new Koopas the default properties of Koopa 
while allowing you to override them, giving each Koopa a unique set of properties.

```lua
-- green_koopa.lua

require "moo"
require "koopa"

package("GreenKoopa"):extends(Koopa)

-- We're happy with the defaults of the Koopa class, but 
-- obviously want to change the name!

GreenKoopa:has("Name", "Green Koopa")
```

We've used two new methods in the above example, `extends` and `has`. `extends` will tell our class to inherit the object you pass to it, and `has` is used to override the properties. 
That's basically all there is to it.

You can easily loop through the children of a base class.

```lua
-- test.lua
require "koopa"
require "green_koopa" -- don't forget to load the other koopas

print("Found " .. #Koopa.children .. " koopas!")

for _, v in pairs(Koopa.children) do
  print("Name: " .. v:GetMyName()) -- GetMyName() was defined in the base class (Koopa)
  print("Can bounce: " .. tostring(v.CanBounce))
end
```

If you don't need or want direct access to the parent, you don't even have to include the koopa base

```lua
-- test.lua
require "green_koopa"

print("Green Koopa's name is " .. GreenKoopa.Name)
```

Last thing to note - you can return an **instance** of an object by calling it as a function.

```lua
require "green_koopa"

local gkoopa = GreenKoopa()
```
